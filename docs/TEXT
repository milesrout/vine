		So how then does the editing of text occur?

As might be obvious, the representation of text in a text editor is of the
utmost importance.  Vine uses what is called a 'piece chain' to store text.

		What is a piece chain?

At its simplest, a piece chain is a doubly linked list of 'pieces'.  A piece
is a pointer into a buffer and a length.

{buf: 'abcdefghijkl'}
{new: ''}

<text initially 'abcdefghijkl'>

tc_numpieces: 3
tc_pieces: [[buf,12)]
tc_current: 0
{new: ''}

<insert 'ABC' in middle>
<text is now 'abcdefABCghijkl'>

tc_numpieces: 6
tc_pieces: [[buf,12), [buf,6), [newbuf,3), [buf+6,6)]
tc_current: 1->2->3
{new: 'ABC'}

<insert 'DEF' in first quarter>
<text is now 'abcDEFdefABCgihjkl'>

tc_numpieces: 6
tc_pieces: [[buf,12), [buf,6), [newbuf,3), [buf+6,6), [buf,3), [newbuf+3,3), [buf+3,3)]
            'ab...l'  'abcdef' 'ABC'       'ghijkl'   'abc'    'DEF'         'def'
tc_current: 5->6->7->2->3
{new: 'ABCDEF'}

		Insert within an existing piece

Create three new pieces.  The first should be everything up to the cursor
position of the current piece.  The second should contain the newly inserted
character.  The third should be everything after the cursor position in the
current piece.  The old piece in the list should be substitued for
first->second->third.

		Insert at the boundary of two existing pieces

Create one new piece.  It should contain the newly inserted character.
before->new->after should be substituted in place of before->after in the list.

		Delete a character
